![in-game screenshot](https://libregamewiki.org/images/1/18/Pacman.png "in-game screenshot")

This is a clone of the original Pacman by Namco.

The main goal is to learn SDL2 with a game.


## Install hint ##

You have to compile the Linux version on your own. For this, you'll need
* libsdl2
* sdl2-image
* sdl2-ttf
* and sdl2-mixer.

(make sure to take the devel packages) 
Then, download and extract the zip file or clone the pacman repository.
Inside the pacman directory, run
```
cd src
make
```
